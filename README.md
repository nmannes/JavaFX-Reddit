# Final Project (Team H)

## State of the Project

* Web Scraping has yet to be implemented, so all data visible in the display as of now is fabricated.
* Hyperlink objects are clickable, and send the user to the category of page (i.e. Post view, User view) that the link would otherwise link to.  For instance, clicking a username in a post will bring the user to a dummy userpage.
* Usernames in comments are not yet clickable due to a design oversight, and will be corrected in future versions.
* Formatting is a work in progress
* Icons for upvoting and downvoting are a work in progress - we do have dummy upvote and downvote images but in retrospect they don't look very nice.
